# Cohort360

## Architecture

- [ ] Add Architecture schema 

Cohort360 consists of a React front-end and a Django back-end (REST API).

This repository hosts the front-end, while the back-end will be available soon.

Both the front-end and the back-end depend on a third, possibly custom, party: an endpoint to query medical data and to create cohorts.
This third endpoint can be a FHIR API for example. This is the case for the first creators of Cohort360.

## Installation

### Requirements:

* A running back-end server
* A running third party endpoint (FHIR API for example)
* An authentication server
* Node.js (16 or higher) installed

### Running the front-end

1. First copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and edit this file to match your configuration.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm audit fix`
4. Run `npm run build`

This will generate files in the `build` directory that can be exposed via a web server like Nginx, or a node server.

An example configuration with Nginx can be found [here](.templates/nginx.conf)

## CI

A [gitlab-ci.yml](.templates/.gitlab-ci.yml) is available in the `.templates` folder, alongside
a [nginx configuration](.templates/nginx.conf) example (useful for deployment).

## Deployment

A docker image is available to build via the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile). You only need to update the location of your nginx conf.

A contributing guide will be published soon.
