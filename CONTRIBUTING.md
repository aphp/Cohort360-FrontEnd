## Contributing to Cohort360

As an open source project, **Cohort360** welcomes contributions of many forms:
 * Creating an issue for bug report
 * Readme improvements
 * New feature you would like **Cohort360** to have

To help make your contribution to this project successful, we do have a few guidelines in place.  

Each PR, no matter how small, should have a GitHub **issue** associated with it.

Here's a quick checklist for a **good PR**:

1. A GitHub Issue with a good description associated with the PR
2. One feature/change per PR
3. We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) for more readability. This helps generate a well 
   organized changelog file
4. One commit per PR. If necessary, squash commits before pushing you branch
5. Rebased your branch on main (`git rebase`, not `git pull`) 
6. Add a good descriptive commit message, with link to issue.  
   For example:  
  > feat(cohort): add amazing feature #issue-number
7. No changes to code not directly related to your PR/issue
8. Add tests to cover new code
9. Run tests locally before pushing changes


Once you have submitted your PR please monitor it for comments/feedback.

We appreciate your help to make **Cohort360** an even better open source project!
